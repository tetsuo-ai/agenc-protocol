# Changelog

Entries below `v0.2.1` are `@tetsuo-ai/protocol` package releases from the
devnet era. Mainnet program deployments are recorded as dated entries; the
authoritative deployed-state record is
[`docs/MAINNET_MAINLINE.md`](./docs/MAINNET_MAINLINE.md).

## 2026-07-18 — adversarial-swarm wave complete (S-1–S-9, all items)

- a 13-agent adversarial swarm re-audited the full program after the F-1–F-19
  queue; every confirmed finding landed in a staged, gate-green commit on
  `fix/audit-findings-2026-07-16` — 415 Rust unit tests, 310 litesvm
  integration tests, 520 SDK tests (+e2e); clippy default+canary, artifacts,
  canary freeze, IDL reference, and SBF stack-frame check all green
- **CRITICAL** (`1b562b4`): `expire_dispute` no longer pays a self-disputing
  no-show 50% of escrow — expiry refunds the funder in full (post-P6.3 every
  expired dispute is unresolved); accepted-bid bond on expiry always refunds
- **HIGH** (`96fa6bd`): `initiate_dispute` stamps `last_dispute_initiated`, so
  the deregistration cooldown that guards `apply_initiator_slash` actually
  binds (it read a never-written field — dead code)
- **MED**: `validate_task_result` settles completion bonds on accept
  (`ab5b297`); `close_task` requires the canonical bid book and refuses while
  bids are live (`3e7a364`); ValidatorQuorum votes require the
  min-stake-for-dispute floor (`81d3be2`); delegation closed as a slash-vault
  for dispute defendants and the deregister→re-register reputation inflation
  loop killed via identity continuity (`ed0752a`, errors 6359/6360)
- **LOW batches** (`0b34a81`, `89779cf`): legacy-parent zero-pad load for
  `create_dependent_task`; u128 fee math in purchases; saturating dispute
  counters; slash-settlement rent to the creator; governance snap-vote floor;
  contest cancel deposit forfeit; deregister bid gate (error 6361) +
  verification-badge sweep; `TaskBidBook` rent sweep; `cancel_task` SBF stack
  fix (`task` boxed)
- **Docs**: D8–D13 added to `docs/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md` — quorum-is-friction,
  governance vote-weight redesign note, resolver leg conflict bound, V-2
  revote wedge, durable-dispute preflight, and the deliberate rejection of the
  dependency gate on ghost/frozen exits (money-never-locks)

## 2026-07-18 — full audit hardening queue complete (F-1–F-19, all items)

- the ENTIRE 2026-07 audit hardening queue is implemented and gated on branch
  `fix/audit-findings-2026-07-16` — 414 Rust unit tests, 296 litesvm
  integration tests, 520 SDK tests; clippy default+canary, artifacts, canary
  freeze, and IDL reference all green
- **P1** (`56f2451`): F-7 `reject_and_freeze` SOL-only guard (new error 6358)
  and F-4 `expire_claim` cleanup-reward skip on token tasks (was
  InsufficientFundsForRent on every token task)
- **P2**: F-8 (`b72ff99`) MCP tool-error + crash-handler sanitization with a
  shared redact module and rebuilt dist; F-9 (`53e2c4b`) dispute exits sweep
  the defendant's live submission (counters + worker rent) via optional
  trailing accounts; F-10 (`e89e525`) `auto_accept_task_result`'s hire_record
  is required + seeds-pinned (permissionless leg-skip closed)
- **P3**: F-11 expire_claim live-submission evidence guard + F-15 saturating
  recovery counters (`631a10f`); F-14 uniform bid-settlement offset on
  reject/expire paths + F-16 u128 fee math (`0c8f1a0`); F-18 multisig
  hardening — authority-membership rotation guard, KEEP sentinels for
  launch-control stale reads, dead helper removed, model documented
  (`dd519ad`); F-19 off-chain lows — template-name sanitization, URL
  redaction in credible-exit, genesis-hash cluster check, release-gate canary
  check, workflow permissions (`3285675`)
- **F-12**: `scripts/preflight-dispute-scan.mjs` — mainnet scan found 3
  Dispute accounts, all `total_voters == 0` (no legacy-dispute action needed)
- **F-17 + informational**: accepted trade-offs recorded in
  `docs/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md` (D1–D7 — do not re-file)
- remaining: deploy choreography for the whole upgrade package (human-run
  Squads ceremony, `surface_revision` 5 stamp, SDK/protocol minor releases)

## 2026-07-18 — audit P0 hardening queue complete (F-1, F-2, F-3, F-5)

- the full P0 queue from the 2026-07 audit's pass-3 report (TODO.MD) is
  implemented and gated on branch `fix/audit-findings-2026-07-16` — 409 Rust
  unit tests, 290 litesvm integration tests, 520 SDK tests; clippy
  default+canary, artifacts, canary freeze, and IDL reference all green
- **F-1** (`4b70630`): `cancel_task`'s no-show worker-bond forfeit is bound to
  a live no-show claimant — a creator can no longer sybil-claim, no-show, and
  forfeit an honest rejected worker's bond (new error 6356)
- **F-2** (`aa6aae5`): `close_task` can no longer brick the slash finalizers —
  `apply_initiator_slash` drops the Task account entirely, `resolve_dispute`
  keeps `current_workers == 1` while a worker slash is pending,
  `apply_dispute_slash` frees it, and `reclaim_terminal_claim` refuses a
  slash-pending deferred claim (new error 6357)
- **F-3** (`cc8870e`): the completing-accept sole-submission guard now covers
  the quorum/attestation path, and `reclaim_terminal_claim` accepts a
  REJECTED submission as evidence (un-bricking bounced claims)
- **F-5** (`b3eb824`): completion-bond accounts on `cancel_task` and
  `expire_reject_frozen` are required + seeds-pinned — a live bond can never
  be omitted into a terminal task; SDK facade and downstream callers updated
- F-6 is closed by on-chain verification: governance was already initialized
  on mainnet with sane params (2026-07-17)
- deploy choreography for this package (separate human-run step): multisig
  binary upgrade, then a `surface_revision` 5 stamp and coordinated
  SDK/package minor releases — wire changes are confined to non-canary
  instructions (`apply_initiator_slash`, `cancel_task`,
  `expire_reject_frozen`, writable flags on `reclaim_terminal_claim` /
  `apply_dispute_slash`)

## 2026-07-17 — 2026-07 adversarial-audit fixes land (`fix/audit-findings-2026-07-16`)

- the 2026-07-16/17 adversarial audit (three passes) is closed out on branch
  `fix/audit-findings-2026-07-16` (HEAD `d7f9d40`): all blocker fixes landed
  and every gate is green — 408 Rust unit tests, 284 litesvm integration
  tests, 520 SDK tests
- **pass 1 — 12 fixes:** C-1, H-1, H-2, H-3, H-5, M-1, M-2, M-3, M-5, L-2,
  L-3, L-4
- **pass 2 — 4 blocker fixes:** the M-2 schema gate, the H-1 legacy-record
  restore, the M-3 reserve-liveness check, and the L-4
  sanitize + dist + release wiring
- SDK regenerated from the refreshed program artifacts (`packages/sdk-ts`
  generated client committed alongside)
- remaining full-surface / SPL hardening is tracked in `TODO.MD` (F-1..F-19;
  F-6 closed by on-chain verification 2026-07-17) — no canary-reachable
  finding remains open

## 2026-07-09 — Batch-4 goods mainnet surface (99 instructions, `surface_revision = 4`)

- live mainnet binary is the full **99-instruction** surface; last deployed slot
  **431918664** (verified 2026-07-10 via `solana program show`)
- on-chain `ProtocolConfig.surface_revision = 4` (`SURFACE_REVISION_BATCH4`);
  SDK `getDeployedSurface` reports `goods: true`
- goods market live and revision-gated: `create_goods_listing` /
  `purchase_good` / `update_goods_listing` (`GoodsListing` + per-unit
  `SaleReceipt`)
- client cutover: `@tetsuo-ai/marketplace-sdk` **0.11.0**,
  `@tetsuo-ai/protocol` **0.3.0** — see `docs/VERSIONING.md` §1.1 and
  `docs/design/batch-4-goods.md`

## 2026-07-05 — Batch-2 store + batch-3 contest (additive, 94 → 96 ix)

- **batch-2** (`surface_revision = 2`, 94 ix): store identity
  (`register_store` / `update_store` / `close_store`),
  `moderation_heartbeat`, dispute/freeze-exit referrer legs, `rate_hire`
  rollup — sdk **0.9.0**
- **batch-3** (`surface_revision = 3`, 96 ix): contest rails —
  `distribute_ghost_share`, `reclaim_terminal_claim`, submission-rent return
  — sdk **0.10.0** / **0.10.1**
- both batches are additive (no flag-day wire cutover); P1.2-wire clients
  keep working. Design: `docs/design/batch-3-contest-tasks.md`,
  `docs/P5_2_STORE_IDENTITY_SPEC.md`, `docs/MODERATION_LIVENESS.md`

## 2026-07-03 — P1.2 open-roster mainnet deploy (90-instruction surface)

- deploy the P1.2 batch to mainnet (slot 430491216, commit `aad4c0d`), executed
  through the new Squads v4 2-of-3 upgrade-authority vault (`Cj9dWtov…`) — the
  same day the upgrade authority moved off the single key (P0.3, see
  `docs/UPGRADE_AUTHORITY.md`)
- make moderation-attestor registration **permissionless**:
  `register_moderation_attestor` (self-signed, 0.25 SOL refundable bond) +
  `request_attestor_exit` / `finalize_attestor_exit` (7-day cooldown, full
  refund; records rejected from the moment exit is requested)
- move `record_task_moderation` / `record_listing_moderation` to v2
  moderator-keyed PDAs (multiple attestors can attest the same content without
  clobbering); legacy-record grace path via `findLegacy*ModerationPda`
- add the multisig-gated `set_moderation_block` / `clear_moderation_block`
  BLOCK floor and the `set_default_trust_list` surface trust list
- decouple agent domain verification from the roster:
  `record_agent_verification` / `revoke_agent_verification` are global
  moderation-authority-only (P1.2 §4.6)
- **breaking (flag-day wire cutover):** `set_task_job_spec`,
  `hire_from_listing`, and `hire_from_listing_humanless` take a trailing
  `moderator` arg + a required `moderation_block` account; old-wire clients
  fail closed. Client cutover shipped the same day (sdk 0.8.0,
  react/tools/mcp 0.4.0). See `docs/MAINNET_ROLLOUT_RUNBOOK.md` §2.6
- restore the OtterSec verified-build badge for the new bytecode via a
  Squads vault transaction (`is_verified: true` at verify.osec.io; procedure
  recorded in `docs/MAINNET_ROLLOUT_RUNBOOK.md` §2.5)

## 2026-07-02 — WP-A1 roster-honored moderation gates mainnet deploy

- the three moderation consumption gates (`set_task_job_spec`,
  `hire_from_listing`, `hire_from_listing_humanless`) now accept attestations
  authored by a registered, non-revoked `ModerationAttestor` roster entry, not
  only the single global `moderation_authority` (PR #93, commit `254078a`;
  additive optional account, no layout change, no migration)
- at this point roster *membership* was still authority-assigned
  (`assign_moderation_attestor`); registration went permissionless with P1.2
  the next day. Verification record: `docs/WP-A1-DEPLOY-READINESS.md`

## 2026-06-11 — Phase 9 full-surface mainnet upgrade (84 instructions)

- swap the mainnet binary from the 25-instruction `mainnet-canary` build to the
  full default-features surface (`surface_revision = FULL (1)`); mainnet is no
  longer the canary
- migrate the 169 live `Task` accounts (382B → 466B, 0 failures) and
  `ProtocolConfig` (349B → 351B)
- enable all task types and the bid marketplace; private (zk) completion stays
  deferred (`ZkConfig` uninitialized)
- rollout choreography recorded in `docs/MAINNET_ROLLOUT_RUNBOOK.md`

## v0.2.1

- refresh public protocol artifacts for the current reviewed-public marketplace devnet surface
- include launch-control/task-job-spec instructions such as `set_task_job_spec`
- include current CreatorReview settlement account layouts for `accept_task_result` and `reject_task_result`

## v0.2.0

- add marketplace v2 bid lifecycle and settlement flows to the public protocol surface
- add wallet rate-limit bypass protections across agents
- add dedicated devnet readiness validation for the publishable protocol package

## v0.1.1

- add the publishable `@tetsuo-ai/protocol` package under `packages/protocol`
- sync package-generated protocol assets from the committed canonical artifacts
- add build, typecheck, and pack-smoke validation for the public package in CI

## v0.1.0

- bootstrap the public `agenc-protocol` repository as the canonical protocol source of truth
- commit the Anchor IDL, generated TypeScript types, and protocol manifest under `artifacts/anchor`
- document the repository as the public trust-surface owner for AgenC
