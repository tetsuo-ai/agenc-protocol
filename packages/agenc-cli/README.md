# @tetsuo-ai/agenc-cli

**The Stripe-4242 moment for AgenC.** Within a minute of one command you
WATCH money settle four ways: `agenc init` wires the repo you are already in
into an AgenC node, `agenc dev` runs counterparty bots that hire + complete
your listing — printing the live 4-way settlement split (worker / operator /
referrer / protocol treasury) with real lamport deltas read from the chain —
and `agenc promote` diffs your project against the go-live checklist.

On a cold machine `agenc dev` needs **zero setup**: when no localnet stack is
discoverable it runs the REAL compiled agenc-coordination program in-process
(litesvm, shipped inside the sdk) — no validator, no anchor build, no RPC.

```bash
npx @tetsuo-ai/agenc-cli init
npx @tetsuo-ai/agenc-cli dev
```

```text

```

(The protocol-treasury leg is the live mainnet 5% fee — both dev sandboxes
seed 500 bps so the demo split is production-truthful.)

## Commands

### `agenc init`

Framework-detects the **current** repo (never greenfield-only):

- **Next.js detected** (`next` in deps): injects a minimal, clearly-marked
  checkout surface — `app/agenc/page.tsx` + `app/agenc/checkout/route.ts`
  (pages-router fallback: `pages/agenc.tsx` + `pages/api/agenc/checkout.ts`)
  plus server-only content-addressed job-spec storage and a public GET route
  — built on the plain-SDK `hireAndActivate` orchestration
  (`@tetsuo-ai/marketplace-sdk`; marketplace-react is NOT required), plus an
  `agenc.config.json` with the listing terms. The scaffolded checkout route is
  **local-development only and fail-closed** on BOTH router variants. It accepts
  the checkout secret only through `x-agenc-checkout-secret` (never a form/body
  field), requires `AGENC_ENABLE_DEV_CHECKOUT=1`, `AGENC_NETWORK=localnet`, and a
  loopback `AGENC_RPC_URL`, and always refuses `NODE_ENV=production`. Its
  in-memory admission policy is not a production authorization system. Replace
  it with authenticated, durable, atomic idempotency/recovery and audited
  total-wallet-debit controls before launch. The development route also requires
  explicit per-checkout/hourly/transaction-fee debit budgets, validates the live
  listing/provider/operator/fee/deadline/capability/version terms, and stores then reads back a canonical
  worker-verifiable envelope before signing the hire. Set
  `AGENC_MODERATOR` to the separate wallet funded by the local attestor (the
  checkout signer is deliberately rejected so external moderation rent/fees
  cannot escape its wallet-debit reservation),
  `AGENC_JOB_SPEC_DIR` to durable shared storage and
  `AGENC_JOB_SPEC_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to the generated route's public HTTPS URL
  (`/agenc/job-specs` for App Router, `/api/agenc/job-specs` for Pages Router).
- **Anything else**: writes `agenc.config.json` + a `worker.mjs` loop wired to
  `@tetsuo-ai/agenc-worker`'s programmatic API (register → watch → claim →
  execute with your own coding-agent CLI → submit → report earnings).
  Generated workers require explicit usable `AGENC_WORKER_ENDPOINT` and private,
  project-specific `AGENC_WORKER_STATE_DIR` values; there is no unusable
  `example.invalid` endpoint or repository-local state fallback.

When the project has **no `package.json`**, init scaffolds a minimal one
(name from the directory, `private: true`, the AgenC deps pre-pinned inside
the support matrix) so `npm install` puts `node_modules` in THIS project —
never hoisted into an ancestor package where `agenc promote` and the wired
templates would not find the sdk. An existing `package.json` is never touched.

`--kind checkout|worker` overrides detection and `--router app|pages` selects a
reviewed Next router migration. Idempotent: identical files are
reported `unchanged`; files whose content differs are **refused** without
`--force`. A forced kind/router migration removes obsolete outputs only when
they still carry the exact `agenc init` marker; edited, non-regular, or symlinked
stale outputs refuse the entire batch and are never deleted. Everything written
lives under paths init owns (`app/agenc/*` or
`pages/agenc*`, `agenc.config.json`, `worker.mjs`, plus the one-time
`package.json` scaffold when none existed).

### `agenc dev`

The show. Resolves a sandbox in this order — it **never** touches mainnet or
devnet (non-loopback RPC endpoints are refused outright):

1. **localnet** — if a `.localnet/env.json` stack is discoverable and
   `127.0.0.1:8899` answers with the program deployed, it reuses the running
   stack; a dead stack is re-booted via the agenc-protocol repo's
   `scripts/localnet-up.mjs` when discoverable.
2. **in-process sandbox (litesvm)** — otherwise it falls back to the REAL
   compiled agenc-coordination program run in-process (the `.so` ships inside
   `@tetsuo-ai/marketplace-sdk`'s testing assets). Zero toolchain, zero
   validator: this is what a fresh `npx @tetsuo-ai/agenc-cli dev` hits, and
   the whole loop lands in seconds. The output labels which mode ran
   (`mode: localnet` vs `mode: in-process sandbox (litesvm)`).

Then, all with throwaway funded wallets:

1. registers a provider agent and creates a service listing for **your**
   project (name/price/fee terms from `agenc.config.json`), with an
   **operator** payee + fee on the listing;
2. attests it CLEAN with the sandbox moderation authority (the localnet
   moderator keypair from `.localnet/env.json`, or the in-process sandbox's
   seeded moderator — no HTTP attestor needed either way; the same
   direct-moderator path the SDK's `localnet-first-hire` example uses);
3. runs in-process counterparty bots: a **buyer bot** that `hireAndActivate`s
   the listing with a **referrer** payee + fee (so the split is genuinely
   4-way) and a **worker bot** — the real `@tetsuo-ai/agenc-worker` runtime,
   reused programmatically with a stub executor — that claims and submits;
   then the buyer accepts (Task Validation V2 submit → accept);
4. prints the settlement as the 4-way split table above, with **real lamport
   deltas read from the chain**, the settlement signature, and the receipt
   URL pattern. (Receipt pages are an agenc.ag **mainnet** surface — in the
   dev sandboxes the printed split + transaction signature are the proof, and
   the output says so.)

Flags: `--sandbox` (force the in-process litesvm mode, skip localnet
discovery), `--localnet` (require the localnet stack — fail with setup
instructions instead of falling back), `--env-file <path>` (explicit
`.localnet/env.json`; implies `--localnet`), `--purge` (kill + re-boot the
stack via the sdk tooling first; implies `--localnet`).

Optional localnet setup, for the full-validator experience (from an
[agenc-protocol](https://github.com/tetsuo-ai/agenc-protocol) clone):
`anchor build`, `(cd packages/sdk-ts && npm install && npm run build)`, then
`node scripts/localnet-up.mjs`. On a warm stack the bot loop lands in well
under a minute (~9s typical); the in-process fallback needs none of this and
lands in seconds.

### `agenc promote`

READONLY diff against the go-live checklist — it never signs, never flips
anything with money. Checks: `agenc.config.json` present/valid, production
RPC configured (and not localhost; inject secret-bearing provider URLs with
`AGENC_RPC_URL` rather than committing API keys), wallet path set + existing + **not** a
`.localnet` throwaway key, installed `@tetsuo-ai/*` pins inside the
[`docs/VERSIONING.md`](https://github.com/tetsuo-ai/agenc-protocol/blob/main/docs/VERSIONING.md)
support matrix (a package may have multiple compatible minor lines — sdk
0.8.x through 0.11.x all speak the live wire (see `docs/VERSIONING.md` §1.1); genuinely stale pins fail closed
against the live mainnet program), a fee-leg rent-exemption advisory, and the
receipts surface. Chain evidence is finalized and pinned to one minimum context
slot; it verifies the upgradeable Program/ProgramData relationship, reviewed
ProgramData address/deployment slot, retained upgrade authority, executable
SHA-256, and reviewed source commit in addition to ProtocolConfig ownership and
surface revision. Broad wire compatibility is checked separately from the
newer SDK/runtime APIs required by generated templates.

`promote` deliberately cannot return production-ready for a generated checkout
or worker based on local files alone. It reports an explicit blocker until an
operator has evidenced production auth, durable admission/recovery, public
job-spec readback, reviewed moderation/listing binding and deployed checkout
canaries (or effective worker endpoints/private state/bounds and a deployed
worker canary). This prevents a local-only checkout that always returns 503 in
production from being reported ready. Prints pass/fail with the exact next action per gap —
including where to get a wallet (`solana-keygen new`) and which RPC to use;
`--json` for agents. Exit code 0 only when nothing fails.

## Programmatic use

Everything the CLI composes is exported from the package root: `runInit`,
`runDev`, `runDevLoop` (the dependency-injected bot loop — the e2e suite runs
it against litesvm), `runDevSandbox` (the in-process fallback), `GpaSimulator`,
`runPromoteChecks`, `detectProject`, `formatSplitTable`, and the config
helpers.

## Scope (v1)

Local in-process bots only — no hosted daemon; the counterparty bots run
inside `agenc dev` and exit with it. `dev` is local-only by design (localnet
stack or the in-process litesvm sandbox — never a public cluster).
